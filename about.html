<h1>About Heavyweight</h1>

<p>Sometimes you need to send someone a scary letter, but you don’t have a lawyer.</p>

<p>Enter Heavyweight.</p>

<p>Do you want a modern small firm vibe from Miami, or a white shoe New York firm where partners and serifs abound? Does your imagined law firm need a few Mayflower descendents as partners, or would you prefer names that harken back to Enron executives?</p>

<p>Each variable input has been hand selected to maximize law firm aesthetic, but you’re in the driver’s seat. Once you’ve gotten those options just right, just enter your letter text. You’ll get a beautiful PDF that is ready for you to print out on the highest weight paper you can find.</p>

<p>All of the gravitas, none of the fees.</p>

<h2>FAQ:</h2>

<h3>Is this legal?</h3>
<p>Making fake letterhead is constitutionally protected speech. <b>We’ve designed the options so that they imply a law firm but don’t explicitly claim to be from a lawyer.</b></p>
<p>Sending fake lawyer letters, or impersonating an attorney, could get you in some trouble—so use it at your own risk. We take no responsibility for any uses of this tool, etc, etc.
</p>

<h3>Why law firm letterhead?</h3>
<p>The law is as much about appearance as it is actual practice, and letterhead is a great place to illustrate that. Law is a credence good—it’s often difficult or impossible for non-lawyers to tell how good the legal services they’re receiving are. That means that folks often look to other signals to determine lawyer quality—stuff like hourly rate, fanciness of office, and the snootiness of the formatting. Also, the recipient of a letter on letterhead is way more likely to take something seriously.</p>

<p>Lawyers know that. That’s why law firm letterhead is quite highly regulated. State bars have rules as to who can be on it, who can use it, and what lawyers can use it for. That makes it a fun medium to explore how lawyering is partially just about aesthetics.</p>

<p>Basically, at least some of what lawyers sell is lawyer <i>vibes</i>. We're making that part free.</p>
